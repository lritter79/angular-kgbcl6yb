Requirements:
Fetch Data
Use the PokéAPI to retrieve a list of Pokémon. Use Angular's HttpClient to make the request.
Display in a Table
Display the Pokémon in a table with at least the following columns:
Name
Image (use the sprite from the individual Pokémon details, e.g., sprites.front_default)
Base experience
Note: The initial API only gives names and URLs — you'll need to make additional requests per Pokémon to get full details.
Bonus:
Add pagination or infinite scroll.
Allow sorting by name or experience.
Add a filter/search input.

Expectations:
Use Angular best practices (e.g., services, observables).
Use Angular Material or a basic HTML table — your choice.
You can use any styling or design you're comfortable with.
